# CAN Standards

Certainly, here's a comprehensive list of various CAN-based protocols and technologies:

1. **J1939:** Commonly used in heavy-duty vehicle applications such as trucks, buses, agriculture, and construction equipment.

2. **CANopen:** Used in industrial automation, medical devices, maritime systems, and other applications.  

3. **DeviceNet:** An industrial network protocol used to connect industrial automation devices.

4. **CAN Kingdom:** Implemented on top of CAN for maritime navigation systems.

5. **MilCAN:** A CAN-based protocol used in military vehicles.

6. **NMEA 2000:** A CAN-based protocol for marine electronic devices to share data like navigation information and engine statistics.

7. **CANaerospace:** An avionics protocol with extensions to CAN defined in the ARINC 825 standard.

8. **ISO 11898:** The serial communication protocol standard that defines the CAN data link layer. There are different ISO 11898 standards for high and low-speed CAN.

9. **CAN FD (Flexible Data rates):** An extension to CAN that increases the data payload.

10. **TTCAN (Time-Triggered CAN):** Adds time-synchronized messaging on top of CAN. 

11. **SafetyBUS p:** A CAN-based protocol with extensions for functional safety systems.

These protocols and technologies leverage the underlying CAN bus to meet the specific needs of their respective industries and applications.
